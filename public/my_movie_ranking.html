    <h1>The Best Movies According to Flav</h1>

    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>The Prestige</h3>

    />
    <p>
      The best movie for me perfectly embodies all the flaws, temperaments, and
      vices of humanity.

    <h3>Pursuit of Happyness</h3>

    <p>
      It competes very well with the movie 'The Prestige' for the best film
      category; this film reminds you that in life, some events/obstacles are
      not as difficult as we make them out to be in our minds.
    </p>

    <h3>Shutter Island</h3>
    <img

      height="350"
    />
    <p>
      A suspense-filled movie, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo
      delivering impeccable performances; the ending is the highlight of the
      entire film.
